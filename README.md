Example Android app showing the configuration of Proguard with Raygun
=======================

Steps: 

1. Build with gradle
2. Note the debug build type has the *runProguard* setting as *true*
3. Raygun is included as a .jar in the *lib* folder, rather a gradle dependency. Gradle doesn't recognise it for some reason
